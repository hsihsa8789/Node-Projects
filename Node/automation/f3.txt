Thanks for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is Shivam Ray. I'm from Patna, Bihar. I have done my schooling at MRS high school Maniyari.

And I have done my graduation in BCA from Bra Bihar University. I'm a hardworking self-motivating person.

My short-term goal is to work at a reputed company like yours where I can improve my skills. My long-term goal is to be placed in a respected position in MNC.

My weakness is my lack of communication and getting nervous to interact with strange people, but I will improve these weaknesses very soon.

That's all about me
